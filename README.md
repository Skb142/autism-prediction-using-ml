# Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

🚧 **Status: Work in Progress** 🚧  
This project focuses on building and improving a machine learning model for predicting autism based on relevant features and datasets. The goal is to design a complete pipeline covering preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.  

A key highlight of this work is the use of **advanced ensemble methods**, including:
- **XGBoost**
- **CatBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **Stacking Classifier (ensemble of multiple models)**


 📌 Project Overview
- Develop a machine learning pipeline for autism prediction.
- Apply advanced gradient boosting techniques (XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM).
- Implement stacking to combine multiple models for improved accuracy.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- Visualize results for better interpretability.
